# MouseWiggler
Teensy BadUSB Arduino HID Mouse Wiggler (Leonardo Lily GO)

Ever needed someone to keep wiggling the mouse to stop a machine from going to sleep? This tiny script for a teensy arduino device is the answer. It moves the mouse backwards and forwards every second. That's it.

You're welcome.
